Feature: Instance Type Narrowing
    In order to easily narrow instances
    I should be able to call a stongly-named method to narrow a type to an instance

Scenario: Positive narrow ClassA|ClassB to ClassA
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a constant of ClassA | ClassB union type
    When the constant contains ClassA
    Then the result of isInstance should be "ClassA"

Scenario: Negative narrow ClassA|ClassB to ClassA
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a constant of ClassA | ClassB union type
    When the constant contains ClassB
    Then the else result of isInstance should be "ClassB"
