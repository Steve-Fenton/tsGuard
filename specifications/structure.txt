Feature: Structural Type Narrowing
    In order to avoid writing a custom type guard
    I should be able to call a stongly-named method to narrow a type based on structure

Scenario: Positive narrow structure
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a structural type
    When the constant contains a required structure
    Then the result of isStructure should match

Scenario: Negative narrow structure
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a structural type
    When the constant does not contain a required structure
    Then the result of isStructure should not match
