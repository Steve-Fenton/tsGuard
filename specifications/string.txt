Feature: String Type Narrowing
    In order to avoid mis-spelling of the magic "string" string
    I should be able to call a stongly-named method to narrow a type to string

Scenario: Positive narrow string|number to number
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a constant of number | string union type
    When the constant contains a string
    Then the result of isString should be "string"

Scenario: Negative narrow string|number to number
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a constant of number | string union type
    When the constant contains a number
    Then the else result of isString should be "number"
