Feature: Object Type Narrowing
    In order to avoid mis-spelling of the magic "object" string
    I should be able to call a stongly-named method to narrow a type to number

Scenario: Positive narrow object|number to object
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a constant of object | number union type
    When the constant contains a object
    Then the result of isObject should be "object"

Scenario: Negative narrow object|number to object
    Given I import tsGuard
    And I have a constant of object | number union type
    When the constant contains a number
    Then the else result of isObject should be "number"
